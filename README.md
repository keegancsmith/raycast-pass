# raycast-pass

[Raycast](https://www.raycast.com/) Extension for [pass](https://www.passwordstore.org/), the standard unix password manager.

I want [rofi-pass](https://github.com/carnager/rofi-pass) on a mac. This projects initial goals are to implement what I use in rofi-pass:

- [x] paste password or field into current application.
- [ ] otp support
- [ ] autotype support
